          <h1>Matthew Lansford</h1>
          <h2>Student at James Madison University</h2>


          <p>Hello my name is Matt Lansford and I have been studying computer science at James Madison
          University for the past 3 years. I have the most experience using the language of java and working individually as well as in teams to accomplish projects.
         My real strength is being able to adapt and work in many different types of situations and with many different types of people.
       Whether it be leading a group or being a follower I am able to do both. I believe this comes from my background in sports as well as joining a fraternity freshman year of college.
       Another one of my strengths is my quick thinking and math-oriented mind which allow me to solve unique problems quickly.
     What I am looking for is a company that I can add value to as well as develop my skills as a computer scientist and gain some real world experience.  </p>

           <p>In my advanced programming class we had to recreate the classic game of Asteroids. Aside from some provided files,
           we had to create all the elements of the game including the asteroids, background, ship, bullets, and more. We also had to calculate the speed
           and position for the items in order to determine collisions and all. This was a fun and challenging process, but was very rewarding when all the
           requirements were met.</p>
